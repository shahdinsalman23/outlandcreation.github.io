                        <h2>What We Can</h2>
                        <p>Outland Creations is an inventor-centered bespoke ecommerce platform working to champion
                            makers and innovators. Whatever you’re working on—works of fiction, tech gadgets, fashion
                            accessories, kitchen innovations—you want to see it get off the ground. But when you’ve
                            created something from scratch, and you’re working by yourself, getting to the next stage
                            can pose a challenge. So often, great ideas are stymied as creators struggle to rally people
                            to their vision.</p>
                        <p>Think of us as a digital showroom with advanced ecommerce platform features that allow you to
                            fully showcase your wares. Now is the time to ignite interest, connect with collaborators,
                            and receive funding. All creators know the importance of visibility. Outland Creations gives
                            you added exposure and traction as you shepherd the life of your art.</p>

                        <p>Amazon may or may not be promoting your book. A producer and director may or may not be
                            attached to your screenplay. Your invention may or may not have made its way into the
                            market. But, under the Outland Creations brand, your work is on display all year long.
                            Because we cap our product capacity at 3000 items, you can take advantage of prime placement
                            on a thriving yet unsaturated platform—a space beyond your own website where you can direct
                            people to view what you’ve made.</p>

                        <p>As our brand evolves, we will be working to inaugurate a range of exciting initiatives. Our
                            non-profit arm will support individuals and foundations spearheading great work in the
                            world. Ultimately, we want to be in a place to buy book IP rights from authors who want to
                            sell.</p>
                        <p>For serious creators promoting their work on the platform, our renewal process allows you to
                            stay a part of the family, and if you’re promoting an invention that’s licensed by another
                            company, you can use Outland Creations as an additional resource for marketing your product
                            and enjoy the benefits of a fully integrated ecommerce platform. We’re here to open doors
                            and create opportunities for creatives of every stripe!</p>
